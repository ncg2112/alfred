Alfred Topics

This document contatins the names, format and purpose of each custom ROS topic
used by Alfred. They are defined in the ROS package alfred_msg.


FSRDirection.msg

 float32 x
 float32 y
 bool followPressed

 FSRDirection passes the direction indicated by the FSR ring. This direction is
 initially computed by the PIC pre-proccessor, and then communicated by UART over
 USB to the Atom development board. Then it is published within this message by
 the no alfred_table.

 x and y are the cartesian components of the direction indicated.
 followPressed is the state of a single-bit button, which is used to indicate the
   start of follow mode. It will only be true while the button is pressed.


FSRUpDown

 int8 UpDown

 FSRUpDown passes the desired vertical direction, indicated by the FSR ring. This
 direction is initially computed by the PIC pre-proccessor, and then communicated
 by UART over USB to the Atom development board. Then it is published within this
 message by the no alfred_table. 

 UpDown is a single int. 0 corresponds to no movement, -1 to down, 1 to up.
