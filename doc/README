Alfred
Cornell Cup 2013, Columbia University

The docs contained here will be updated as they are developed.
A general outline of the project, its mechanical and electrical desgin,
is assumed. See our other documents, project proposals and presentations
for this documentation.

Included here is the documentation of the software system. Primarily, this
consists of documenting each ROS node, its function, and the topics they
publish and subscribe to.



SETUP:

Clone the git repo github:ncg2112/alfred
 git clone git@github.com:ncg2112/alfred.git

Note: To push to this repo you need to have a github account that has permission
to push, which can be set up by nathan, and the computer you are pushing from
must have its ssh key registered on github. This is already set up on Alfred.

Setup ROS workspace
 rosws set ~/electric_workspace/alfred

Assuming that you cloned the alfred repository to ~/electric_workspace.
Each package within the Alfred workspace is already set up as a ROS
package, there is no need to run roscreate-pkg unless you are creating
a new package.
