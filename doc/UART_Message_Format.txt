Alfred UART Message Format

The status of the control elements of Alfred, that is the FSR sensor ring, the up
and down sensors, and the follow button, is pre-processed by an off-board PIC.
This informatin is then passed to the Atom development board by UART over USB.
The format of the messages is defined here.

NOTE:
 This affects the ROS node alfred_table, and the c code on the PIC.
